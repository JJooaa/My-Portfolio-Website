# Personal Portfolio
Website is intended to show a little bit about what I can do, and hopefully land me a job.

## First Version
This is the first version of the website and the way I wrote the code isn't optimal. 
I never write code all in the same file, but on this project I decided to do so.
In the future I will be working on making this more clean.
